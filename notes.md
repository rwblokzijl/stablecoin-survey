# Notes per read item

## 1 APG Email and document

APG wants to track IOU's on a blockchain. This is not necessarily related to
stablecoin, though some concepts might be transferable.

# Questions:

 -

 Requirements for a good stablecoin:

 - how to eliminate default risk (e.g. JPMorgan goes bankrupt)
 - provide strongest possible legal certainty
 - design space:
     - a single central collateral bank account
     - multiple collateral bank accounts
     - Each participant has a single collateral bank account
     - Each participant has multiple collateral bank accounts
 - avoid single legal zone: spread out over the globe, beyond Euro-zone?
 - more?
