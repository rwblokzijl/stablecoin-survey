# Introduction

Without stablecoins payments in bitcoin are converted to USD immediately in
order to reduce risk. Stablecoins allow you to hold and trade the crypto rather
than having to rely on a fiat currency.

Collateralization (Pegging to Stable currencies)

The most common way to stabilise a currency is to hold some form of collateral.
This stabilises the price of the currency by allowing holders of the currency
to always buy and sell at a set price. Traditionally pegs of a currency to
either gold or another currency have been controlled by a regulating authority
holding a reserve of the underlying asset.

In the world of crypto,

Not going into crypto pegged
Pegged to bitcoin: WBTC(btc)

## Collateralization by Centralisation

Dollar: AnchorUSD, Gemini Dollar, Neutral Dollar(aggregate), PAXos, TrueUSD, USD Coin,

Euro: Augmint

Gold: Digix

## Collateralization by Crypto (Stability as a Service)

To the Dollar: MakerDAO(eth), EOSDT(eos), BitUSD

Stabilising is not pegging

Changing parameters to make the currecy respond dynamically to price changes

## Indicators of price changes

### Supply
Hash rate

### Demand
